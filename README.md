# phpstan-rules

Provides additional rules for [`phpstan/phpstan`](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).

## Installation

Run

```sh
$ composer require --dev voku/phpstan-rules
```

## Usage

All the [rules](https://github.com/voku/phpstan-rules#rules) provided (and used) by this library are included in [`rules.neon`](rules.neon).

When you are using [`phpstan/extension-installer`](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer), `rules.neon` will be automatically included.

Otherwise, you need to include `rules.neon` in your `phpstan.neon`:

```neon
includes:
	- vendor/voku/phpstan-rules/rules.neon
```

## Rules

### IfConditionHelper

This helper is used by different "condition"-rules: if - and - or - not - ternary

:bulb: We use this "hack" (helper) to run the check for all kind of conditions.

- double negative string conditions. e.g. `(string)$foo != ''` is the same as `(string)$foo`
  - https://3v4l.org/oDMie
- double negative integer conditions. e.g. `(int)$foo != 0` is the same as `(int)$foo`
  - https://3v4l.org/OWhrc
- double negative boolean conditions. e.g. `(bool)$foo != false` is the same as `(bool)$foo`
  - https://3v4l.org/SHoQP
- double negative null conditions. Use "!==" instead if needed
  - https://3v4l.org/a4VdC
- check 0 vs '' conditions, the behavior was changed in PHP 8
  - https://3v4l.org/lBFHI
- check possible insane comparisons. e.g. `0 == '0foo'`, the behavior was changed in PHP 8
  - https://3v4l.org/BJ6b8
- check insane comparisons. e.g. `0 === '0'` or `false && true`
- check non-empty string is never empty
- check non-empty string is always empty
- check non-empty array is never empty
- do not compare objects with another type
- do not use magic string-concat for objects with "__toString()"
- do not allow assignments. e.g. `if ($a = 0)` (see "checkForAssignments")
- do not allow Yoda conditions. e.g. `Ã¬f (0 == $a)` (see "checkYodaConditions")

#### Configuration

If you want to configure a list of classes / subclasses that can NOT be used in conditions directly:

e.g.:
- ok: `if ($emailValueObject->isValid())`
- error: `if ($emailValueObject != '')`

```neon
parameters:
    voku:
        classesNotInIfConditions: [
            AbstractValueObject
        ]
```

If you want to check assignments e.g. in "if"-conditions you can use this:

```neon
parameters:
    voku:
        checkForAssignments: true
```

If you want to check Yoda conditions can use this:

```neon
parameters:
    voku:
        checkYodaConditions: true
```

### ExtendedBinaryOpRule

This rule will check "+", "*", "/", "-", ... (operators) and "." (concatenation) for compatible types. 

It's included in the default `rules.neon` so that you don't need to add it manually.

### DisallowedCallMethodOnNull

This code is copy&pasted from [`phpstan/phpstan-src`] and I used it to prevent `Call to a member function on null` errors while I wasn't already on level 8 where all kind of "NULL" checks are already covered by default.

e.g.
```neon
rules:
    - voku\PHPStan\Rules\DisallowedCallMethodOnNullRule
```
